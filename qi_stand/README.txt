This is a stand for the Qi charging kit sold by Adafruit.

This is meant to be laser cut, but could just as easily be milled.

Basic instructions:

The first two blocks make up the "top" of the stand. These should be made out
of 3/32 inch (~2.5mm) wood. Anything thin should work fine, but it needs to be
no thicker than the coil on the top of the Adafruit pad. I found that the 2.5mm
thickness was fine, and the thinner Inventables Zebra wood was a nice touch.

The other two blocks I made out of 3/16in 5-ply plywood I had lying around my
hackerspace. 

You will need:

1x Adafruit Universal Qi charging transmitter ( http://www.adafruit.com/product/2162 )

 ******************************************************************************
 * You can find plenty of variations on this on places like DealExtreme, etc. *
 * these may or may not fit the same pattern used by the Adafruit kit for the *
 * PCB. Should you get one of those kits, you should CHECK that the holes are *
 * what you think they are and/or MODIFY the hole pattern for the board.      *
 ******************************************************************************

1x first block, cut from 2.5mm wood (or close enough, as read above)
1x second block, cut from the *same* wood (see above)
1x third block, cut from thicker ply.

 The magenta region needs to be inset the thickness of the metal plate that holds
 the coil on your kit, or a little less. Be conservative, erring on the side of
 needing to sand down these tabs. Once you have the second and third block cut,
 test-fit and make sure you can get your device to charge holding everything together
 with your hands (or bolts). Sand down the SECOND block if it's snug but won't
 charge right when you hold everything together, but sand down the THIRD block
 if it'll it'll charge but won't fit right.

2x fourth block, cut from thicker ply (like the third).

Wood glue, clamps.

#6 (you can get away with #8) SAE hardware OR 4mm hardware for binding. You will
want something along the lines of 1.5in bolts, plus appropriate nuts.

3mm taper-head bolts, 3mm nuts and nylon washers (plenty of them).

Assembly:

def laminate:
Using the wood glue, apply a thin amount between two wooden parts, then hold 
clamped for a long period of time, usu. 3-4 hours.

In this case, we can allow the wood glue to dry in bulk. We'll clamp everything
together in just a bit.

Laminate the two 2.5mm blocks together -- they're symmetrical, so it doesn't
entirely matter which way you do this. Keep your glue fairly thin through this.

Laminate the bottom three parts of the lower half together. Make sure on the top,
the notched part is UP, forming a "cup" that the induction heatsink will sit in.
The two U shaped pieces need to be "away" from the holes that will hold the
controller PCB.

Using the hardware you have, tighten everything together, making sure it looks
right. Clamp the whole stack together and allow the glue to set. You will most
likely have to remove some glue after it's dried, and a light bit of sandpaper
should do you fine.

Dissasemble the top and bottom, clean up and make things look nice.

Countersink any holes you want to make pretty; this isn't *totally* important,
but it is a nice touch.

Countersink the 3mm holes in the top of the bottom assembly, such that they will
fit snug underneath the top. Using nylon washers, shim up enough space for the
Adafruit PCB to fit as shown in the pictures. Use nylon washers and 3mm nuts
to secure it in place.

Optionally, you can go and dremel down the bolts. For pretty points, sand along
the sides. For grippy points, dremel down the bolts AND add some rubber feet.
