The Hanabi tokens are intended to be cut and engraved.

The first set of Hanabi tokens uses the Material design language built by Google for their Android system. It's intended to be cut onto
transparent acrylic, then the insets colored in via spray paint or another means, using the cut areas as a masking. Red lines should be cut
just enough to cut through the masking on the material.

The second set was built from Segoe MDL2 Assets: Stopwatch and GuestUser represent the "time" (or "fuze" tokens) and the information tokens.
This is designed to simply be engraved and cut into 3/4 inch circles. These circles are marked in black. It's totally feasable to paint one
side a different color to denote it's state in the game.

These files are given as-is with no explicit license. The license on Segoe MDL2 assets is implied that it's part of Windows. Do with that
what you will.
