mill-laser-print
================

This is a set of drawings and models for 2.5D milling, 2D lasering and 3D printing.

Each project folder should have a README of its own

Software
---------

2.5D milling and 2D lasering files are commonly built with DraftSight. LibreCAD should be able to open `.dwg` easily.

Notes on Milling
-------

Milling projects are built for the Shapeoko and commonly I use CamBam at my local hackerspace, and if MakerCAM had support for DXF, it'd be totally easier.
