This is a stand for my Gilette SA double edge safety razor.

I use 3mm polyacrylate for this, and whatever your laser cutter does best is usable.

Cyan lines should be folded inwards, and probably shouldn't be cut. Green is
for engraving at maybe...2mm? It should be pretty deep. You're perfectly free to
just cut it, and melt down the back.
