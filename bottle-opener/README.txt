Bottle opener made from the same materials as the Inventables bottle opener.

If you have some of the Easel milled bottle openers, you can line it up
and re-use the metal! ~ recycling ~

The drawing is fairly self-explanatory. Make sure to mill the items in the "SHARED"
layer are milled on all parts.

There's one gotcha: The CYAN block on layer 0 should be milled as a pocket at
maybe 1.25mm deep. This should be done BEFORE the profile around the inside of
opener. This pocket is the effector on the bottle opener.

** MILL THE OUTER PROFILE LAST. YOU WILL DESTROY YOUR ENDMILL OTHERWISE. **

    Learn from my mistake; I killed my endmill while cleaning up a pass.
    I milled to 3.33mm deep, then tried to do a second pass. This proved
    to be a poor choice. Don't make my mistake.

I used a 1mm two flute endmill with some coolant, milling about 0.02mm deeper
than the material. In terms of milling parameters, if your CAM software supports
it, use a Spiral cutting pattern. It just is nicer.

Clean using isopropyl and high-grit sandpaper, towel, water.
